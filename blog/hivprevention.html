            <p>HIV care has changed significantly since the development of AZT was developed in the 80s. During early development, the medication was often toxic and unproductive but today, people with HIV can often lead very productive lives. Most regimens today involve three different active substances, each targeting a different part of aspect of the HIV lifecycle.</p>
<h4 id="nrti-nukes-">NRTI (Nukes)</h4>
<p>Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors were some of the earliest medications developed and specifically targeted the lack of &quot;spellchecking&quot; mechanism of HIV. Medications were analogs of bases commonly found in DNA (the A,C,G,Ts), except they lacked the 3&#39;-hydroxyl group necessary for continued replication. Human proteins often screen out these nucleotides during replication so they are not integrated into human DNA. However, HIV does not have this mechanism so it stops replication of new HIV baby viruses. </p>
<h4 id="prevention">Prevention</h4>
<p>Most people often think of condoms when talking about HIV prevention, but using HIV medications to prevent HIV transmission has been available for since the &#39;90s. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been used in healthcare settings for individuals who stick themselves during work (occupational exposure). These individuals take medications to root out the virus during early infection before they can integrate themselves effectively into CD4s. However, PEP only has ~84% efficacy and must be started within 72 hours of exposure. Many hospitals and public health clinics have offered PEP to clients, but recently, studies have started providing PEP to people at risk of contracting HIV. This regiment, known as &quot;Post-Exposure Prophylaxis&quot;, is like taking &quot;birth control&quot; for HIV and seems to be effective. However, cost-effectiveness of providing expensive medication as prevention is still under scrutiny but it is a promising tool in HIV prevention.</p>
