[Kanshu](http://jltran.github.io/kanshu/) is a mobile/web app for learning chinese that I am helping with on github. I worked on creating a splash page - it doesn't currently have any marketing copy, just pieces put together different components of a splash page.

I used jekyll to get the site up and running and bourbon/neat for the front-end. The main benefit of Bourbon is it forces cross-platform support on whatever you build so you don't have to worry about IE-8 as much. However, with autoprefixer, a library like Bourbon is less necessary. It was, however, nice to have some presets that you don't have to rebuild. I really enjoyed using the grid system in Bourbon for some reason.
