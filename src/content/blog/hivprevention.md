The Berkeley Free Clinic is a volunteer-run clinic which comes with it's own downsides. One of those is the relative lack of infrastructure and subsequent reliance on volunteer for emergency situations. In 2011, a surge of accidental needle sticks prompted the creation of a team dedicated to respond to these emergencies. Because of our clinic's focus on providing services for the homeless and disenfranchised, HIV and HCV - both bloodborne diseases, are more at higher ferquency than baseline.

Most importantly, speed of response plays a critical role in outcome. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been used in healthcare settings for individuals who stick themselves during work (occupational exposure). These individuals take medications to root out the virus during early infection before they can integrate themselves effectively into CD4s.

As part of this process, we:  
++ developed a clinic-wide post-exposure protocol  
++ integrated biohazard training for all volunteers  
++ set up google voice number to immediately notify all team members in case of emergency  
++ standardized interview process of both source and exposed
