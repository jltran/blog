Well-intentioned oppression is, unfortunately, a mainstay of current medical care. The average appointment for primary care today lasts around 15-minutes and this is exacerbated by increased demand for services (Affordable Care Act). Perhaps a more insidious problem, however, is the authoritarian stance some providers take. Providers are in a position of authority in the office, but that does not mean they are necessarily right. Honest communication and partnership can go a long way to improving patient care. Aspects such as the framing sessions in a more open-ended way and allowing patients to control the flow (and perhaps time-frame) of appointments are things we might consider. After all, goals of providers and patients are the same: improving health.
